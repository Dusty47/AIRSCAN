# AIRSCAN
AIRSCAN is a little bash script I  wrote. It's main goal is to start airdump-ng automatically.
Also you WILL need to edit your wierless card into the bash script. The default wierless card is wlx00c0ca97e839.
AIRSCAN will automatically install all dependecies.To install AIRSCAN just type in these commands: git clone https://github.com/Dust47/AIRSCAN  Then type unzip AIRSCAN.zip Next type cd AIRSCAN Last type sudo bash AIRSCAN.sh
