# AIRSCAN.sh
AIRSCAN is a very, very, very tiny bash script I wrote. Its goal is to start airdump-ng, so you don't need to do it manually.
You WILL need to edit your wireless card into the bash script. 
         
The default wireless card is mine wlx00c0ca97e839.

AIRSCAN will automatically install all dependencies type in these three commands: 

#1 git clone https://github.com/Dust47/AIRSCAN

#2 chmod +x AIRSCAN.sh

#3 sudo bash AIRSCAN.sh

To stop the script, press (ctrl + x)
