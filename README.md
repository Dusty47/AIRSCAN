# AIRSCAN.sh
AIRSCAN is a little bash script I  wrote. It's main goal is to start airdump-ng automatically.
Also you WILL need to EDIT your WIERSLESS CARD into the bash script. 

The default wierless card is wlx00c0ca97e839.

AIRSCAN will automatically install all dependecies.To install AIRSCAN just type in these commands: 

git clone https://github.com/Dust47/AIRSCAN 

cd AIRSCAN

unzip AIRSCAN.zip
