# AIRSCAN.sh
AIRSCAN is a little bash script I  wrote. Its main goal is to start airdump-ng automatically.
Also you WILL need to EDIT your WIRELESS CARD into the bash script. 
         
The default wireless card is wlx00c0ca97e839.

AIRSCAN will automatically install all dependencies.To install AIRSCAN just type in these commands: 

git clone https://github.com/Dust47/AIRSCAN

chmod +x AIRSCAN.sh
-------------------
sudo bash AIRSCAN.sh

This program was made using Geany!
